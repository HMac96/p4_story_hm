		<h1>History</h1>

		<h2>Archaeological evidence shows settlers living on the Faroe Islands
			in two successive periods before the Norse arrived, the first between
			300 and 600 AD and the second between 600 and 800 AD.</h2>

				<p>Scientists from the University of Aberdeen have also found early
					cereal pollen from domesticated plants, which further suggests people
					may have lived on the islands before the Vikings arrived. Archaeologist
					Mike Church noted that Dicuil mentioned what may have been
					the Faroes. He also suggested that the people living there might have
					been from Ireland, Scotland, or Scandinavia, possibly with groups from
					all three areas settling there.</p>

					<p>A Latin account of a voyage made by Brendan, an Irish monastic saint
						who lived around 484–578, includes a description of insulae (islands)
						resembling the Faroe Islands. This association, however, is far from
						conclusive in its description</p>

	<p>The Norse and Norse–Gael settlers probably did not come directly from
		Scandinavia, but rather from Norse communities surrounding the Irish Sea,
		Northern Isles and Outer Hebrides of Scotland, including the Shetland and
		Orkney islands. A traditional name for the islands in Irish, Na Scigirí,
		possibly refers to the (Eyja-)Skeggjar "(Island-)Beards", a nickname given
		to island dwellers.</p></div>

		<p>Dicuil, an Irish monk of the early 9th century, wrote a more definite account.
			In his geographical work De mensura orbis terrae he claimed he had reliable
			information of heremitae ex nostra Scotia ("hermits from our land of I
			reland/Scotland") who had lived on the northerly islands of Britain for almost
			a hundred years until the arrival of Norse pirates.</p>



		<p> Norsemen settled the islands c. 800, bringing Old West Norse, which evolved
			into the modern Faroese language. According to Icelandic sagas such as Færeyjar
			Saga, one of the best known men in the island was Tróndur í Gøtu, a descendant
			of Scandinavian chiefs who had settled in Dublin, Ireland. Tróndur led the
			battle against Sigmund Brestursson, the Norwegian monarchy and the Norwegian
			church. </p>

			<p>According to the Færeyinga saga, more emigrants left Norway who did not
				approve of the monarchy of Harald Fairhair (ruled c. 872 to 930). These
				people settled the Faroes around the end of the 9th century.Early
					in the 11th century, Sigmundur Brestisson (961–1005) escaped to Norway. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="body_grid_2">
			<p> He was sent back to
				take possession of the islands for Olaf Tryggvason, King of Norway from
				995 to 1000.</p>

			<p>Sigmundur introduced Christianity, forcing Tróndur í Gøtu to convert or
				face beheading and, though Sigmundur was subsequently murdered, Norwegian
				taxation was upheld. Norwegian control of the Faroes continued until 1814,
				although, when the Kingdom of Norway (872–1397) entered the Kalmar Union
				with Denmark, it gradually resulted in Danish control of the islands. The
				Reformation with Protestant Evangelical Lutheranism and Reformed reached
				the Faroes in 1538. When the union between Denmark and Norway dissolved as
				a result of the Treaty of Kiel in 1814, Denmark retained possession of
				the Faroe Islands; Norway itself was joined in a union with Sweden. </p>

			<p class="pull_quote2">Following the turmoil caused by the Napoleonic Wars
				(1803-1815) in 1816, the Faroe Islands became a county in the Danish Kingdom.</p>

	<p>As part of Mercantilism, Denmark maintained a monopoly over trade with
		the Faroe Islands and forbade their inhabitants trading with others (e.g.
		the geographically close Britain). The trade monopoly in the Faroe Islands
		was abolished in 1856, after which the area developed as a modern fishing
		nation with its own fishing fleet. The national awakening from 1888 initially
		arose from a struggle to maintain the Faroese language and was thus culturally
		oriented, but after 1906 it became more political with the foundation of
		political parties of the Faroe Islands. </p>

	<p>In the first year of World War II, on 12 April 1940, British troops occupied
		the Faroe Islands, shortly after the Operation Weserübung with the Nazi German
		invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940. In 1942–1943 the British Royal Engineers,
		under the leadership of Lt. Col. William Law MC, built the only airport in the
		Faroe Islands, Vágar Airport. Control of the islands reverted to Denmark
		following the war, but Danish rule had been undermined, and Iceland's independence
		served as a precedent for many Faroese. </p>

	<p>The 1946 Faroese independence referendum resulted in 50.73% in favor of
		independence to 49.27% against.The Faroe Islands subsequently declared
		independence on 18 September 1946; however, this declaration was annulled by
		Denmark on 20 September on the grounds that a majority of the Faroese voters
		had not supported independence and King Christian X of Denmark dissolved the
		Faroese Løgting on 24 September. The dissolution of the Løgting was
		on 8 November followed by the Faroese parliamentary election of 1946 in which
		the parties in favour of full independence received a total of 5,396 votes
		while the parties against received a total of 7,488 votes.</p>

		<p class="pull_quote2">As a reaction to the growing self-government and
			independence movements, Denmark finally granted the Faroe Islands home-rule
			with a high degree of local autonomyon 30 March 1948.</p>

		<p>In 1973 the Faroe Islands declined to join Denmark in entering the European
		Economic Community (later absorbed into the European Union). The islands
		experienced considerable economic difficulties following the collapse of the
		fishing industry in the early 1990s, but have since made efforts to diversify
		the economy. Since then, support for independence has grown and is the objective
		of the Republican Party. </p>
