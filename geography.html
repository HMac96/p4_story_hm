	<h1>Geography</h1>

	<h2>The Faroe Islands are an island group consisting of 18 major islands
				(and a total of 779 islands, islets, and skerries) about 655 kilometres
				(407 mi) off the coast of Northern Europe, between the Norwegian Sea
				and the North Atlantic Ocean, about halfway between Iceland and Norway,
				the closest neighbours being the Northern Isles and the Outer Hebrides
				of Scotland. Its coordinates are 62°00′N 06°47′W. </h2>


	<p>The islands cover an area of 1,399 square kilometres (540 sq. mi) and
					have small lakes and rivers, but no major ones. There are 1,117 kilometres
					(694 mi) of coastline. The only significant uninhabited island is
					Lítla Dímun.The islands are rugged and rocky with some low peaks; the coasts are mostly
					cliffs. The highest point is Slættaratindur in northern Eysturoy, 882 metres
					(2,894 ft) above sea level.</p>

			<p>The Faroe Islands are made up of a approximately 6 kilometers thick succession
				of mostly basaltic lava which was part of the great North Atlantic Igneous
				Province during the Paleogene period. The lavas were erupted during the
				opening of the North Atlantic ocean, which begun about 60 million years ago,
				and what is today the Faroe Islands was then attached to Greenland. The lavas
				are underlain by circa 30 km of unidentified ancient continental crust.

	<h3>CLIMATE & NATURE</h3>

	<p>The climate is classed as subpolar oceanic climate according to the Köppen
		climate classification: Cfc, with areas having a tundra climate, especially
		in the mountains, although some coastal or low-lying areas can have very
		mild-winter versions of a tundra climate. The overall character of the
		islands' climate is influenced by the strong warming influence of the
		Atlantic Ocean, which produces the North Atlantic Current. This, together
		with the remoteness of any source of landmass-induced warm or cold airflows,
		ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0 °C or 37 to 39 °F)
		while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5 °C or 49 to 51 °F).</p>

	<p>The islands are windy, cloudy and cool throughout the year with an average of
		210 rainy or snowy days per year. The islands lie in the path of depressions
		moving northeast, making strong winds and heavy rain possible at all times of
		the year. Sunny days are rare and overcast days are common. Hurricane Faith
		struck the Faroe Islands on 5 September 1966 with sustained winds over 100 mph
		(160 km/h) and only then did the storm cease to be a tropical system.</p>

		<p>The climate varies greatly over small distances, due to the altitude, ocean
			currents, topography and winds. Precipitation varies considerably throughout
			the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover can last for months with
			snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks,
			summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal
			locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. Tórshavn
			receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the
			south. Snow is also seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands
			nearby. The area receives on average 49 frosts a year.</p>

		<p>	The collection of meteorological data on the Faroe Islands began in 1867.
			Winter recording began in 1891, and the warmest winter occurred in 2016–17
			with an average temperature of 6.1 °C (43 °F).</p>

	<h4>NATURE</h4>


		<p>The natural vegetation of the Faroe Islands is dominated by arctic-alpine plants,
		wildflowers, grasses, moss and lichen. Most of the lowland area is grassland and
		some is heath, dominated by shrubby heathers, mainly Calluna vulgaris. Among the
		herbaceous flora that occur in the Faroe Islands is the cosmopolitan marsh thistle,
		Cirsium palustre. A few small plantations consisting of plants collected from similar climates such as Tierra del
		Fuego in South America and Alaska thrive on the islands. </p>

		<h4>FAUNA</h4>

		<p>The bird fauna of the Faroe Islands is dominated by seabirds and birds attracted
			to open land like heather, probably because of the lack of woodland and other
			suitable habitats. Many species have developed special Faroese sub-species:
			common eider, Common starling, Eurasian wren, common murre, and black guillemot.
			The pied raven, a color morph of the North Atlantic subspecies of the common
			raven, was endemic to the Faroe Islands, but has now become extinct. Only a few
			species of wild land mammals are found in the Faroe Islands today, all introduced
			by humans. Three species are thriving on the islands today: mountain hare (Lepus
			timidus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), and the house mouse (Mus musculus).
			Apart from these, there is a local domestic sheep breed, the Faroe sheep
			(depicted on the coat of arms), and there once was a variety of feral sheep,
			which survived on Lítla Dímun until the mid-19th century. </p>

			<p>Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) are common around the shorelines.
				Several species of cetacea live in the waters around the Faroe Islands. Best known
				are the long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melaena), which are still hunted by
				the islanders in accordance with longstanding local tradition. Orcas (Orcinus orca)
				are regular visitors around the islands.</p>

			<p>The domestic animals of the Faroe Islands are a result of 1,200 years of isolated
				breeding. As a result, many of the islands' domestic animals are found nowhere
				else in the world. Faroese domestic breeds include Faroe pony, Faroe cow, Faroe
				sheep, Faroese goose, and Faroese duck.</p>
