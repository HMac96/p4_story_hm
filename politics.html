	<h2>The Faroese government holds executive power in local government affairs.
		The head of the government is called the Løgmaður ("Chief Justice") and serves as Prime
		Minister and head of Faroese Government.</h2>

		<div class="body_grid">
		<p class="body_grid_1">Any other member of the cabinet is called a landsstýrismaður/ráðharri ("Male Minister of the Faroese Government") or
			landsstýriskvinna/ráðfrú ("Female Minister of the Faroese Government"). The Faroese parliament – the Løgting ("Court of Law") –
			dates back to Viking times and is believed to be one of the oldest parliaments in the world. The parliament currently has 33 members.</p>

		<p class="body_grid_2">In contemporary times, elections are held at municipal, national (Løgting) and Danish (Folketing) levels. Until 2007, there were seven
			electoral districts, each comprising a sýsla, while Streymoy was divided into a northern and southern part (Tórshavn region). However,
			on 25 October 2007, changes were made such that the entire country is one electoral district, giving each vote equal weight.</p>

	<p>Administratively, the islands are divided into 29 municipalities (kommunur) within which there are 120 or so settlements. Traditionally,
	there are also the six sýslur (similar to the British "shire": Norðoyar, Eysturoy, Streymoy, Vágar, Sandoy, and Suðuroy). Although today
	sýsla technically means "police district", the term is still commonly used to indicate a geographical region. In earlier times, each sýsla
	had its own assembly, the so-called várting ("spring assembly").</p>

	<h3>RELATIONSHIPS</h3>

	<h4>Relationship with Denmark</h4>
	<p>The Faroe Islands have been under Norwegian/Danish control since 1388. The 1814 Treaty of Kiel terminated the Danish–Norwegian union,
		and Norway came under the rule of the King of Sweden, while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland remained Danish possessions. From
		ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (Løgting), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an
		ordinary Danish amt (county), with the Amtmand as its head of government. In 1851, the Løgting was reinstated, but, until 1948, served
		mainly as an advisory body.</p>

		<p>The islands are home to a notable independence movement that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of
			World War II, some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, an independence referendum was held
			on the question of secession. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the
			first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the Danish kingdom.</p>

		<p>The result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the Løgting, together with the majority, started the process
			of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the Løgting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament
			member, Jákup í Jákupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the Løgting. The
			Speaker of the Løgting declared the Faroe Islands independent on the 18th of September 1946.</p>

			<p>On the 25th of September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the Løgting, that the king had dissolved the parliament, and wanted new
				elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority. A parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political
				parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose
				to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the Folketing passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe
				Islands' status as a Danish amt was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported
				by a financial subsidy from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services. In protest to the new Home Rule Act, the
				Republic Party (Tjóðveldi), was founded.</p>

				<p>At present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the
					Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an
					immediate unilateral declaration of independence. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the
					Danish government and the Danish nation. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy
					even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.</p>

					<p>As of 2011, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the Danish Prime Minister,
						Lars Løkke Rasmussen, as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then
						they must declare independence.</p>

<main class="main2">

	<h4>Relationship with the European Union</h4>
<p>As explicitly asserted by both treaties of the European Union, the Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union.
	The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed
	reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the War in Donbass in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of
	fresh salmon to Russia. Moreover, a protocol to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates
	that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. </p>

	<p>Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not citizens of the European Union (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens).
		The Faroes are not covered by the Schengen Agreement, but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen
		country (the Faroes have been part of the Nordic Passport Union since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between
		the Nordic countries and the rest of the Schengen Area as part of the Schengen agreement).</p>

		<h4>Relationship with <br>International Organizations</h4>
	<p>The Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement
		with Denmark. The Faroe Islands are a member of some international organisations as though they were an independent country. </p>

		<p>The Faroe Islands are a member of several international sports federations like UEFA, FIFA in football and FINA in swimming and EHF in
			handball and have their own national teams. The Faroe Islands have their own telephone country code, Internet country code top-level
			domain, banking code and postal country code.</p>

	<p>The Faroe Islands make their own agreements with other countries regarding trade and commerce. When the EU embargo against Russia started
		in 2014, the Faroe Islands were not a part of the embargo because they are not a part of EU, and the islands had just themselves experienced
		a year of embargo from the EU including Denmark against the islands; the Faroese prime minister Kaj Leo Johannesen went to Moscow to negotiate
		the trade between the two countries. The Faroese minister of fisheries negotiates with the EU and other countries regarding the rights to
		fish.</p>

			<h3>ECONOMY</h3>

			<p>Economic troubles caused by a collapse of the Faroese fishing industry in the early 1990s brought high unemployment
				rates of 10 to 15% by the mid-1990s. Unemployment decreased in the later 1990s, down to about 6% at the end of 1998.
				By June 2008 unemployment had declined to 1.1%, before rising to 3.4% in early 2009. In December 2014 the unemployment
				was 3.2%. Nevertheless, the almost total dependence on fishing and fish farming means that the economy remains vulnerable.
				One of the biggest private companies of the Faroe Islands is the salmon farming company Bakkafrost, which is the largest of
				the four salmon farming companies in the Faroe Islands and the eighth biggest in the world.</p>

			<p>Petroleum found close to the Faroese area gives hope for deposits in the immediate area, which may provide a basis for
				sustained economic prosperity. 13% of the Faroe Islands' national income comes as economic aid from Denmark. This corresponds
				to roughly 5% of GDP.</p>

				<p>	Since 2000, the government has fostered new information technology and business projects to attract new investment.
					The introduction of Burger King in Tórshavn was widely publicized as a sign of the globalization of Faroese culture. It
					remains to be seen whether these projects will succeed in broadening the islands' economic base. The islands have one of
					the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, but this should not necessarily be taken as a sign of a recovering economy, as many
					young students move to Denmark and other countries after leaving high school. This leaves a largely middle-aged and elderly
					population that may lack the skills and knowledge to fill newly developed positions on the Faroes. Nonetheless, in 2008 the
					Faroes were able to make a $52 million loan to Iceland to help with that country's banking woes.</p>

			<p>On 5 August 2009, two opposition parties introduced a bill in the Løgting to adopt the euro as the national currency,
				pending a referendum.</p>
